== README

Proposed work flow:

* Look at issues for things to work on and assign them to yourself, or create your own issue and assign it to yourself
* Create a new branch with the name in the form yourname/issue_name to work on the issue
* Once you're ready to merge, assign someone else to review/test your code before merging your issue branch with master. If you tag me, I'll get back to you within 24 hours.
* REMEMBER to rebase your work with the most updated version of master BEFORE merging. pls.
